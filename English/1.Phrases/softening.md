To sound polite, tactful, and diplomatic, you should:
1) add a softening word or phrase

- “a little”
This is a bit problematic.
The dots are slightly too big.

- “I’m sorry but...
”I’m afraid it’s not the best solution.
Unfortunately, the export function of dates doesn’t seem to work properly.

- “It looks like....”
Setting up a one-page site seems a better option.
Unfortunately, the export function of dates doesn’t seem to3work properly.

2) use a modal verb
“It’s possible that.../ Isn’t it possible that...?”
This might/could be problematic.
This would be quite difficult to implement at this point.
Wouldn’t that bea bit too difficult?

3) replace negative words with positive ones

- “This isn’t good”
This plan is a bad option.>> This plan wouldn’t be the best option.
I think we’ll fail. >> I don’t think we’ll succeed.

1 We add ‘a bit (too)’, ‘a little (too)’ and ‘slightly (too)’ before adjectives: It’s a bit too / a little too / slightly too difficult



I can't do it. I'm afraid/unfortunately I am not able to do it. 
Could, would, might instead of can, will
