1) ask for an explanation/clarificationORcheck that you understood someone correctly

“Can you clarify that?”
- What do you mean by[small changes]?
- Can you be a bit more specific about what you mean by[small changes]?
- Can you elaborate on[the requirements]?

“I think you mean (+rephrase)”
- So basically what you’re saying is [we’ll have to do overtime].
- If I understand you correctly, [we’ll have to do overtime].


2) confirm/deny that the listener understood you correctly

- “Yes, you (basically) got it right”
Yes, that’s correct.
Yes, pretty much.

- “No, you didn’t get it right”
No, not really.

3) explain what you mean and check others’ understanding

“I mean...”
- What I mean is[we need to hire another developer].
- So basically what I’m saying is[we need to hire another developer].
- [....] Let me expand on[the requirements].

“Do you understand?”
- Does that make sense? 

4) signal you didn’t hear

“I didn’t hear”
- Sorry, I didn’t hear the last part.
- Sorry, I missed that bit.
- I’m afraid I didn’t catch [the question].


“You misunderstood me”
- I think there must be some misunderstanding.
I’m afraid that’s not what I mean.

“What I really mean”
- What I’m trying to say is[we need to hire another developer].

“Sorry about the misunderstanding”
- [We need to hire another developer, not a BA]. 
Sorry if I didn't make that clear.
