When function finishes its works it gets popped off the stack.
So what happens when things get popped off the stack?
Well, we remove the variable environment.

And the heap just gets cleaned up by the garbage collection.
So why can we use closures? Again, that's because of 
We can have functions that return functions, functions as first class citizens, and we have this idea of lexical scope where we write the function matters, not where we call the function or where we invoke the function.
