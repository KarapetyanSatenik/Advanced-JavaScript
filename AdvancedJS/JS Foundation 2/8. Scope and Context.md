### Scope and Context

Scope is a function based thing, scope means what is the variable access of a function when it is invoked?
Context, on the other hand, is more about object based.
Context says what's the value of the this keyword, which is a reference to the object that owns that current executing code.
Context is most often determined by how a function is invoked with the value of this keyword and scope refers to the visibility of variables.
