# THIS

This is the object that the function is a property of.
And this refers to the object that the function is a property of.

When the global execution context starts during the creation phase, we create the global object and (this) and they equal each other. GLOBAL OBJECT === THIS
For example the window object is our global object.

## use strict
Use strict was added to JavaScript as a way for us to avoid the common mistakes that can happen with JavaScript.
When the language was originally designed, it wasn't perfect and there were bits and pieces of mistake and things like use strict allow us to not have this where this refers to the window object.

And you strict can be added at the beginning, the first line of a function or at the beginning of our script.

This refers to whatever is to the left of the dot. obj.getName()
So methods are functions that are inside of objects. So the property and methods can be accessed with this dot notation.
This is whatever to the left of the dot, which is the object that the function is a property of.

So in this case it gives Sing access to the object so that it can use properties and methods within that object.


```js
// 1
const user = {
  name: "Satenik",
  sing() {
    return this.name;
  },
  getSing() {
    return this.sing;
  },
};

console.log(user.getSing()()) //undefined

// This is whatever to the left of the dot,

// 2
const user = {
  name: "Satenik",
  sing() {
    return this.name;
  },
  getSing() {
    return this.sing() + "!";
  },
};

console.log(user.getSing()) // Satenik
```

Չնայած այն հանգամանքին, որ this-ը որոշվում է կանչման պահին, կարևոր է հաշվի սռնել նաև այն հանգամանքը,
թե որտեղ է այդ ֆունկցիան ստեղծվել:

```js
const user = {
  name: "Satenik",
  sing() {
    return this.name;
  },
  getSing() {
    return foo() + "!";
  },
};

const foo = () => {
  return this.name;
};
console.log(user.getSing()); //undefined
```

Arrow functions don't have their this.

```js
const user = {
  email: "my@email.com",
  updateEmail: email => {
  this.email = email
  }
}

user.updateEmail("new@email.com")
console.log(user.email)
```

It's important to remember that before function we should have dot.

```js
const user = {
  name: "Satenik",
  sing() {
    return this.name;
  },
  getSing() {
    return this;
  },
}; 

console.log(user.getSing().sing())
```

```js
//1
const user = {
  name: "Satenik",
  age: 23,
  setAge(val) {
    this.age = val;
    return this.age;
  },
  updateObjectProperty() {
    return this.setAge;
  },
};

console.log(user.updateObjectProperty()(34));
console.log(user.age);

// 2
const user = {
  name: "Satenik",
  age: 23,
  setAge(val) {
    this.age = val;
    return this.age;
  },
  updateObjectProperty() {
    return this.setAge(15);
  },
};

console.log(user.updateObjectProperty());
console.log(user.age);

```

```js
const user = {
  name: "Satenik",
  foo(val){
    this.age = 45
    this.val = val
    return this.val
  },
  sing() {
     this.age = 12
     return this.foo  // this === user
  },
  getSing() {
    return this.sing()   // this === user
  },
};

console.log(user.getSing()(34)); // foo(34) this === global object
console.log(user.age); // 12 
console.log(user.val); //  undefined

```

So to review this is usually determined by asking, hey, execution context, what called the function, what called me.
So you can think of this as "who called me".
this === "who called me"
