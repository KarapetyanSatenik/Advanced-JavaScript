Every time we create a function, we create a new function execution context which has its own variable environment.

- Any time I see a block of code that is these curly brackets {}, it's going to create a new world, a new environment, which is called block scope. 
Block scoping means declaring a variable not just inside a function, but around any curly brackets, like if statements or loops.

When we declare a variables globally in each file, everything gets bunched up together. Everything is on the same global execution context and they overwrite each other if there's any duplicates.
