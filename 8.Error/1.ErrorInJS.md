In JavaScript, we have the throw keyword and when we throw something, your script that we're currently running stops executing. You can throw anything in JavaScript.
When we throw something, it stops the execution of our program.

Error constructor has 3 important properties.
```js
let error = new Error("oopsie")
error.name
error.message
error.stack // So it's actually show me what's happening on our call stack. in which functions you get an error. 
```

And as soon as an error happens on the call stack, we go to the execution context underneath us and say is there a cache for us? If it couldn't find the error handler, in browser we will get an onerror(), but in nodejs we will get an uncaughtException.
So the runtime handles the errors if nothing in our program catches this.

- We can catch the error two ways.
1. Using try catch 
2. catch() method.

```js
function throwAnError(){
    try {
        throw new Error("oopsie")
        console.log(12); // will never be printed
    } catch (error) {
        console.log(error.message);
    }
  console.log(12) // if I run this function, this part is never going to get run because we're running the try catch block and code outside of try catch will never be run.
}
```
We also have the finally block which says no matter what happens in the try catch block, I will work.

- We also can have nested try catch blocks

```js
try {
  try {
    something();
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(error);
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
}
```

Now this try catch block works with synchronous errors or synchronous code.
In JavaScript, we don't only write synchronous code, we write asynchronous code as well.
So how do we handle that?
